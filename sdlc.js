// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/

// Planning
// Analysis of Requirements
// Design
// Implementation
// Testing & Integration
// Maintain





//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you. 
*/
const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 

const analysisOfRequirements = "In this step it is determined what the software or application needs to be able to do. It also must be dertermined what resources will be needed to complete the project."

const design = "The design phase models the way the application should work. Often a prototype is created in this phase to represent how the application should work."

const implementation = "This phase is where the actual writing of the code takes place. Large projects are often created by teams in a collaborative enviornment."

const testingAndIntegration = "In this phase the programs are tested on all sorts of platforms/devices to make sure that the software runs smoothly and does not have bugs. Once tested it is made available to users."

const maintain = "That this point the application is completed and in use. Bugs that were not found during the testing period are fixed and any new updates and features that users would like are added to the program."
